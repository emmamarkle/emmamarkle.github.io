I am an undergraduate at Amherst College, pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Spanish, with an expected graduation date of May 2026. Since Fall 2024, I have been privileged to contribute to the Amherst College Natural Language Processing Lab (ACNLP), working on projects such as UMR Generation, UMR Parsing, and Visual Question Answering with AMR, among others. I am currently developing my senior thesis under the mentorship of Dr. Shira Wein, focusing on low-resource languages and machine translation.

# Research Interests

My research centers on natural language processing (NLP), with particular interest in computational linguistics and semantics. I am especially passionate about multilingual and low-resource languages and advancing techniques in machine translation.

# News
